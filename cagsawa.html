	One of the things that placed Bicol on the map is the beautiful Mt. Mayon. However, as beautiful   and majestic she is, she can also be dangerous. Such was the case when it erupted violently in 1814 which left a town destroyed. The Cagsawa Ruins is what’s left of this town including the ruins of the 1616th-century Franciscan church.

	The Casagwa Ruins are the remnants of a church destroyed during the violent eruption of Mount Mayon in 1814.  The eruption buried the town of Cagsawa under layers of volcanic debris, leaving the church belfry as a haunting reminder of the tragedy. Today, it is a symbol of resilience and a popular tourist destination.
